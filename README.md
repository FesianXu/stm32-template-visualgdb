A template of STM32f103zet6 in Visual Studio using compile tools VisualGDB.
Attention: 
This template is a version without uCOS, and I put the StdPeriphLib into the local project folder, which might bloate the project 
but make it more flexible.
This template is built in VisualGDB in Visual Studio, which can facilitate the process of development.
